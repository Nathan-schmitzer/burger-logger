# burger-logger

Description: A fun little app that dynamically POSTS and DELETES burgers from the webpage!

Usage: In this fun app you can create and name burgers you desire to be devoured! This was used to help understand the functionality of utilizing the concept of MVC! 

Dependencies: Dependencies used in this app were mysql, express-handlebars, and express. Diving into these dependencies allowed us to connect our code editor to mysql and update information in the database! Utilizing the MVC structure allowed me to connect pieces together to use CRUD operations to allow the user to Create, Read, Update and Delete burgers they created!
